# Trivial Torrent Project: Client and Server

## Trivial Torrent Client

You need to implement the client part of the Trivial Torrent protocol. See the Trivial Torrent protocol specification document for details (section 2.3.1).

Use the file `src/ttorrent.c`.

The `ttorrent` command shall work as follows:

~~~{.diff}
$ bin/ttorrent file.ttorrent
~~~

## Trivial Torrent Server

Implement the server part of the Trivial Torrent protocol. See the Trivial Torrent protocol specification document for details (2.3.2).

Use the file `src/ttorrent.c`.

The `ttorrent` command shall be extended to work as follows:

~~~{.diff}
$ bin/ttorrent -l 8080 file.ttorrent
~~~

### Multi-client implementation strategies

The server part can be implemented using two different strategies: employing a *forking server*, or employing *non-blocking sockets*.
Employing non-blocking sockets can be *very* challenging. Follow one of the two approaches based on your personal preferences.
**Follow the conservative approach if you are not sure which approach is best for you.**

| Approach       | Description                                                                      |
| :-             | :------------                                                                    |
| *Conservative* | First implement the server employing a forking server model (mandatory; 70% grade), then upgrade the server to employ non-blocking sockets (optional; 30% grade). |
| *Audacious*    | Implement *directly* a server employing non-blocking sockets (100% grade).       |

Note: servers employing non-blocking sockets must employ a single process and must not employ threads.

## Practical Details

### Building

Use `make` in a terminal to build your project.

~~~{.bash}
$ make
~~~

This will create the executable file `bin/ttorrent`.

### Reference binary

For your convenience, a reference binary is provided in the `reference_binary` directory. You can use this binary as a reference server while you develop your client,
and as a reference client while you develop your server.

### Testing

Some preliminary tests on the trivial torrent client can be performed as follows.

In one terminal run the reference server:

~~~{.bash}
$ reference_binary/ttorrent -l 8080 torrent_samples/server/test_file_server.ttorrent
~~~

In another terminal employ your client to download the file that the server is making available.

~~~{.bash}
$ bin/ttorrent torrent_samples/client/test_file.ttorrent
~~~

You can compare the original and the downloaded files using `cmp` to make sure they are equal.

~~~{.bash}
$ cmp torrent_samples/client/test_file.ttorrent torrent_samples/server/test_file_server.ttorrent
~~~

Note: this command does not output anything if both files are equal.

Additional tests may be run with:

~~~{.bash}
$ make test
~~~

Note that gitlab runs `make test` for you every time you push something to this repository. You can see the results in the `CI/CD` tab.
